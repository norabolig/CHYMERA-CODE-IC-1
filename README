o These files are used for setting up one type of initial conditions for CHYMERA simualtions.
The files include a restart file, header files, Makefile definitions, and the readin file
fort.5. 

o The file has a 0.5 Msun star with a 0.07 Msun disk.  The disk extent is about 50 AU.  
The restart file arrays have dimensions JMAX,KMAX,LMAX=512,64,256.


o Using these ICs -- as from the main CHYMERA-CODE-PROJECT README.

      * Simulation ICs are available for users through github. For your first run, consider the ICs in
        CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1. Do the following, assuming PWD=$CHYMERA_HOME, where CHYMERA_HOME is the directory 
        where you can see bin, run, radhydro, etc. I'm also assuming the CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1 is available in 
        the $HOME directory, but this can be anywhere of the user's choosing.
          1). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/ic.dat to run/fort.7
          2). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/fort.5 to run/.
          3). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/units.h to headers/.
             -> Note that placing header files in the patch directory will not work at the moment. I'm
                aware fo the issue and working on it.
          4). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/hydroparam.h to headers/.
          5). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/Makefile.DEFS to bin/.
          6). cd bin
          7). make
             -> The code fort.7 file is binary, little endian.  If you have a big endian machine, before
                running the code type
                
                  export GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT="little_endian"

                for bash.  

             -> If you are using a compiler other than gcc, adjustments will need to be made.

          8). cd ../run
          9). ./chymera-omp
          10). When finished, you will have files to analyze.
          11). cd ../analyze
          12). Make sure sigplot and midplot have been compiled.
          13). ./midplot 10 11 10 512 64 256 0.159 0.167 0.167 3. 1. ../run/temperat3d. tk_
          14). ./sigplot 10 11 10 512 64 256 0.159 0.167 0.167 -18. 8.9e6 ../run/rho3d. sig_ 
          15). python makeimage.py
          16). xv png/sig_000010.png
          17). Make edits in makeimage.py to analyze temperature next, and look at the tk image
               along with time sig image.

      * A few notes on image files:
          1). rslts.* contain lots of output regarding the simulation. It is in ascii format.
          2). gamma1.* contain the adiabatic index. This is only needed for variable gamma sims.
          3). coolheat_full.* big file containing output regarding heating terms and optical depths
          4). saved.* restart files.  
          5). massflow.* files tracking mass flow on and off the grid, as well as accretion onto a
              central object if used.
          6). rho3d.* volume density output
          7). temperat3d.* temperature output
          8). There are other files.  Some are uesful, others are not.  I am trying to clean this up.

      * Known issues
          1). Mind the stack size limits.  If the code has an immediate segfault, the stack size might
              be too small.  Increase using the commands "ulimit" in bash and "limit" in (t)csh.
